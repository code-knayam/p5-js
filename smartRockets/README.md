# Smart Rockets

In this practice problem, we are creating smart rockets.

The rockets evolve the "best" path to a target, moving around obstacles.
Here we are using genetic algorithm for rockets to decide the best path, every time a new generation iof rocket is created. 
Eventually every rocket tries to follow the best path upto the target.
A mutation is generated in every generation to deviate a particular rocket from the path to include some randomness.
