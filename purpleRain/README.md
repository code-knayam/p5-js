# Purple Rain

In this practice problem, we are creating a rain type effect using p5.js

We are creating objects of type Drop. And each drop has its own attributes like speed, x position and y position.
We are updating the position of the drop by the fall function, where it is updated by ySpeed - a random number.

When the drop falls beyond the height of the frame, its position is again set as 0 ie on top.

Watch the Rain here -
